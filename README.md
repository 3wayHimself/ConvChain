ConvChain passes a sample image through a 1-layer lattice of small overlapping receptive fields. It then runs an MCMC simulation with obtained weights as coefficients in the energy functional.

Besides universality, an important advantage of ConvChain is that it can "fill the gaps", i.e. organically continue pre-placed content created by humans or other algorithms. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/byyKHre.gif).
